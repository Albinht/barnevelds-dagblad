2. **Database Connection Optimization**
   - Configure Prisma connection pooling for production
   - Set up database connection monitoring
   - Implement connection retry logic
   - Add database health checks

3. **Migration Management**
   - Set up automated migration deployment pipeline
   - Create database backup strategy before migrations
   - Implement rollback procedures for failed migrations

## 2. Deployment & Infrastructure

### Platform Setup:
1. **Production Deployment (Vercel/Railway/AWS)**

## 4. Performance & Monitoring

### Production Optimization:
1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement Redis for session storage
   - Add page-level caching for articles
   - Set up CDN caching rules
   - Database query optimization and caching

2. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry/Bugsnag)
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Database query performance tracking
   - User analytics and engagement metrics

## 5. Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Data Protection:
1. **Automated Backups**
   - Daily database backups with retention policy
   - Media files backup to cloud storage
   - Configuration and code backups
   - Test restore procedures regularly

2. **Disaster Recovery Plan**
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Set up staging environment for testing
   - Create emergency contacts and escalation paths

## 6. Security & Compliance

### Security Measures:
1. **Application Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - CSRF protection
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection
   - Rate limiting for APIs

2. **Infrastructure Security**
